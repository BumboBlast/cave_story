CAVE STORY REMAKE
	(from youtube tutorial)
================================

18-apr-21:	added first project files
				- README
				- SLDL Library (holy shit why the hell was that so difficult, i barely even know what this is yet)
				
			Details:	have a class entirely to graphics
						screen size is 640 x 480

						split up headerfiles/ implementation files (Whatever that means)
						create a graphics class, then call it from main (for now i guess)

next time:	make a class that holds the game loop
				- Listen for events in the game loop
				- inputs for commands to close the window
				- make a skeleton for the game class
